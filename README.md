# zero-shot-absa

## About
The goal of this project is to accomplish aspect-based sentiment analysis without dependence on the severely limited training data available - that is, the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis is not explicitly supervised, an approach known as “zero-shot learning”. Sentiment analysis has already been used extensively in industry for things such as customer feedback; however, a model such as the one I am proposing would be able to identify topics in a document and also identify the sentiment of the author toward (or associated with) each topic, which allows for detection of much more specific feedback or commentary than simple sentiment analysis. 

## Details
`zero-shot-absa` uses three models; the first uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to find topics in documents, implemented through gensim. The second is a zero-shot learning text classification model, which assigns each of the word lists generated by the LDA model to one of the user-specified topic labels. The third is a sentiment intensity analyzer, which is run on subsets of the corpus for each topic. 

## Dependencies
- `python` 3.6 <= version <= 3.9
- `gensim`
- `NLTK`
- `transformers` from huggingface.co
- `ijson`

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elicox0/zero-shot-absa.git
python3 -m venv ../absa-env
source ../absa-env/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install transformers
pip install datasets
pip install gensim
pip install NLTK
python -c 'import nltk; nltk.download("stopwords"); nltk.download("wordnet")'
```

## Data
`zero-shot-absa` currently supports `.json` and `.txt` files. Data should be provided as a single file; `zero-shot-absa` uses memory-efficient generators to mitigate any memory errors from large input files.
